	<h3> It's ridiculous. These elected officials have gotten so much money from Comcast and have done so much to hurt net neutrality and protect this company's monopoly in return that they might as well be Comcast's employees.  So, let's treat them like the Comcast customer service team that they are! Do we have a problem with their service? Yes we do. Please call them now!</h3>
